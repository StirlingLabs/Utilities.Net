**Common utilities used throughout the Stirling Labs codebase**

## How to use

Once [Issue #3](/StirlingLabs/Utilities.Net/issues/3) has been resolved, 
a NuPkg will be available.

## What's included

Any stand-alone code that is used in more than one package is a contender to be included 
here, or broken out into it's own package.  It's a bit of a judgement call between the 
two options sometimes, so if you see something that you think should be included, please
[create an issue](/StirlingLabs/Utilities.Net/issues/new) or PR so we can discuss it.
