**Common utilities used throughout the Stirling Labs codebase**

## 🚀 How to install

If you've [configured GitHub Packages](/StirlingLabs/Logging/blob/master/docs/GitHubPackages.md), you can just:
```bash
> dotnet add PROJECT package StirlingLabs.Utilities
```
or just use NuGet however you would normally.

## 👀 What's included

Any stand-alone code that is used in more than one package is a contender to be included
here, or broken out into it's own package.  It's a bit of a judgement call between the
two options sometimes, so if you see something that you think should be included, please
[create an issue](/StirlingLabs/Utilities.Net/issues/new) or PR so we can discuss it.
